# Python for Algebraists - Foundations

## Repository Overview
This is the foundation repository for learning Python through algebraic thinking. We bridge mathematical concepts with computational problem-solving.

## Learning Path

### Module 1: Python Basics
- **Variables & Operations**: Translating algebraic expressions to code
- **Built-in Functions**: Using Python's mathematical tools
- **Documentation Skills**: Learning to find answers independently

### Module 2: Custom Functions  
- **Function Syntax**: Creating reusable mathematical operations
- **20 Challenges**: Practical algebraic problems to solve
- **Math-to-Code Translation**: Thinking computationally about algebra

### Module 3: Control Flow
- **Conditional Logic**: Making decisions in code (if/else)
- **Loops**: Repeating operations (for/while)
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Breaking down complex problems

### Module 4: GitHub Setup
- **Version Control**: Tracking changes to your code
- **Portfolio Development**: Building your coding presence
- **Collaboration Skills**: Working with others on mathematical projects

## Getting Started

1. **Start Here**: `01_python_basics/variables_operations.py`
2. **Test Your Setup**: Run the file to confirm Python works
3. **Explore**: Move through modules in order

## Mathematical Focus
Every programming concept is taught through algebraic applications:
- Mathematical notation → Python syntax
- Function definitions → Python functions  
- Problem-solving → Algorithm design

*"Programming abstracts you from operational hardships and gives you freedom to observe patterns and make better conclusions, which is the primordial goal of math."*
